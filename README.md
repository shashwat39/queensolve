# N-Queens Visualizer

This project is an implementation of an N-Queens Visualizer, which allows users to explore and visualize solutions to the classic N-Queens puzzle. The N-Queens puzzle involves placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.

## Features

- Dynamic Chessboard Interface: The visualizer provides a dynamic chessboard interface where users can interactively place queens and observe the solutions.
- Multiple Unique Arrangements: The visualizer generates multiple unique arrangements of queens for a given board size, allowing users to explore different solutions.
- Step-by-Step Visualization: The visualizer animates the process of solving the puzzle, highlighting the valid positions for each queen placement.
- Adjustable Speed: Users can control the speed of the visualization using a slider, allowing for slower or faster step-by-step animations.
- Information Display: The visualizer displays the number of possible arrangements for a given board size, providing additional context to the user.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the web interface and structure.
- CSS: Used for styling the visual elements of the web page.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the N-Queens puzzle solving algorithm and handling user interactions.

## Setup
